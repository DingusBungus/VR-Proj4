        <a id="learning-objective" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h3>

        <p>The idea of our project was to show the dangers of addictive prescription medication and show how difficult it can be to come out of addiction. The user can make decisions on whether to continue their addiction for a short "fix" to their problem. By the end of the experience, we expect that the user will feel more aware of the dangers of prescription drugs as well as the difficulty addicts face every day.</p>

        <h3>
        <a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Empathy</h3>

        <p>The way we try to generate empathy for our topic is by using decisions, visual effects and a well-defined story line: </p>

        <p>The user starts in a hospital and it becomes apparent that the user was in a car accident. The doctor prescribes medication for them in order to help manage their pain.</p>

        <p>The next scene is after the user has mostly recovered and the doctor asks if the user still has pain. The user by default says yes. Here the user is experiencing withdrawal symptoms but the doctor is unaware. The doctor then asks if the user needs more of the pills or not. This is the first decision moment. The user can choose to get more pills and relieve the withdrawal symptoms, or they can choose not to get more pills, but the withdrawal symptoms will continue.</p>

        <p>In the case that the user does not ask for more pills, they are confronted with another decision. They can take pills to relieve the symptoms, or they can choose not to take the pills and get help. If they choose to take the pills they continue at the scene described in the next paragraph. If not, they go to the end rehab scene and the game ends.</p>

        <p>If the user asked for more pills from the doctor or if the user chose to take the pills after they did not ask for more, they come to the same bedroom scene. They are confronted with the choice of taking pills to relieve their symptoms, but this time there are more dire consequences. If the user chooses to get help, they end up in the end rehab scene. If they do choose to take them, they get an overdose animation and they wake up in the rehab scene with different dialogue.</p>

        <p>The idea behind all of this is that addiction can be very difficult to overcome. By showing blurry animations that simulate withdrawal symptoms, we can mimic the difficult decisions addicts have to make every day. In many cases, severe addicts do not necessarily <i>want</i> to take their drug, but <i>need</i> to in order to function properly. But taking the drug over and over is just a temporary fix to their problem. We are showing that it is easier than some may think to become addicted to a prescription drug and it can be very difficult to come out of. It takes hard decisions and horrible withdrawals to fully recover from an addiction. Hopefully the user sees that taking the drug can be temporary fix, while in the long-run, the best way to go is to stick through the pain and suffering to come out of their addiction.</p>
