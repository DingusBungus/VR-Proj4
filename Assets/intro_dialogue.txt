Doctor: I know you must be in a lot of pain...
Doctor: That car accident did a number on your body...
Doctor: Right now you are on a morphine drip...
Doctor: When you leave I have prescribed you some pain medication...
Doctor: Be careful when taking it because it can be highly addictive.
Me: Thanks Doc... I'm in a lot of pain...
Me: How long will it take to recover?
Doctor: It can vary from person to person, but from your injuries...
Doctor: It should take about a month or so to assume normal function of your legs...
Doctor: It will be a couple of months after that when you can have full function.
Me: I understand... What kind of medication are you prescribing?
Doctor: It is called oxycodone. It is a prescription opiate pain medication.
Doctor: It is very similar to the morphine you have here.
Me: Is it really strong?
Doctor: Yes, I am prescribing a rather large dose due to your injuries...
Doctor: But over time I will decrease the dosage significantly.
Me: Thanks again Doc. I can't thank you enough.
