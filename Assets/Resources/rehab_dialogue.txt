Doctor: It was very smart of you to come here and seek help...
Doctor: Tens of thousands die every year from opiate overdoses...
Doctor: This is your best hope for recovery.
Me: I figured it would be better to get it over with now...
Me: I don't want to have to take these pills every day of my life.
Doctor: Wise choice...
Doctor: Many addicts ruin their lives and then it's too late...
Doctor: It was best for you to seek help as soon as possible.
Me: I just couldn't go on like that.
Doctor: Your recovery won't be easy...
Doctor: Fighting addiction can be extremely difficult...
Doctor: You have already been experiencing withdrawal symptoms...
Doctor: And they will only get worse...
Doctor: But it is much better to be here and recover permanently.
Me: Thanks Doc, I owe you my life.
