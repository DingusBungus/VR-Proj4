Doctor: It seems you overdosed on the pills that I prescribed...
Doctor: I am so sorry, you could have died!
Me: Uhh... Everything hurts...
Doctor: You are currently in a rehabilitation facility...
Doctor: Were you addicted to the pain medicine I prescribed?
Me: No - I mean, I needed them. I'm just glad to be alive.
Doctor: Yes, you were very fortunate that someone was there to help you.
Me: Yeah... I think I need help Doc.
Doctor: Here you will get the help you need...
Doctor: It won't be easy, but you will come out of this alive...
Doctor: It is up to you to make the right decisions for your health and safety.
Me: I understand... It just all happened so fast...
Me: I needed them for pain and then I just needed them.
Doctor: It is very common to become addicted to such substances...
Doctor: Just be careful in the future about taking such addictive medications...
Doctor: You can ask me (or any doctor) for non-opiate pain killers...
Doctor: They can be much less addictive.
Me: Thanks for the advice Doc. I owe you my life.
